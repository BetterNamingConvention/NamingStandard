all you did was fucking clone UNC and rename every mention of UNC to BNC and now you think you can plaster the founder title everywhere as if youve made something revolutionary (most dogshit project i have ever seen)

wow! initialising huh? whats that wait for huh? fake loading effect bc you wanna seem like a very big script that takes time to load? nuh uh

also you guys are fucking stupid, you proceed to do `tostring(identifyexecutor())` without even checking if `identifyexecutor()` is defined

this is a literal UNC test, you should NOT be using UNC functions outside of the testing scope because:
- the entire purpose of the UNC test is to verify whether the function exists
- there is a possibility of the function not existing and therefore erroring your entire script

like what is the purpose in performing a test on `identifyexecutor()` later with the actual UNC verification logic if you *already know* it has failed because your **entire script** has failed to run because of that one print statement near the start of the script
